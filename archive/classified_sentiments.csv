Chirag Bhatt,Overall good average phone,3.0,I hate this product,0,Negative
Siva M,Premium with beasty spec,3.0,"Top-notch and latest hardware specs including perfectly flat display, processor & memory capacity. Battery charging is extremely fast when used with the supplied 120W charger: single digit to 100% in about 30 minutes (phone gets warm at times while charging, but it does not affect the performance). If any standard chargers are used, it will take more time to full charge.Phone design is not out of the ordinary, but some people may like it subjectively. The camera module is just too big for the size of the phone! Sound from the built-in speakers is only normal, do not expect any Atmos or surround-like sound quality. For surround/Atmos, you better use compatible Bluetooth or USB type C wired headsets.The OS is bloated and needs to remove bloatware: it comes with tons of iQOO and Google bloatware. While most Google apps can be uninstalled or disabled, OEM bloatware are terrible. I went by other review comments claiming less bloatware but I was disappointed with the bloatware the device comes with. I used ADB commands to uninstall most of them to get a stock OS like experience, but I couldn't remove or disable five 😞The device comes with a transparent flexible silicone back cover but it does not have a raised lip around the camera module, so, you may scratch the camera glass if you place the device on rough surfaces, so be careful or better get a back cover with raised lip or apply a protector to the camera module. The supplied back cover turns yellow over time, of course.Screen also has a pre-applied screen protector, but it may not be sufficient if you keep keys and the device together. Applied a tempered glass on top of that screen protector for more protection and with that extra layer, display touch and fingerprint reader work just fine (the pre-applied screen protector can be removed too before tempered glass, but I just left it). Since it has a flat display, you have plenty of tempered glass options.Knocked one star off for camera quality because night photography is not impressive for me.Battery gets warmer and drains battery fast when 5G data usage is high esp. with Wi-Fi tethering enabled and connected devices consume lot of data (I think scenarios like this are when the supplied 120W charger is high help).Overall, two stars less because of the bloatware, subpar back cover and average night photography. YMMV.",1,Positive

JUNED GHANCHI,"Camera, performance, built quality, battery",3.0,The result of camera is very good but if you are looking this phone for 100x then this phone is not right choise.because after 10x the result of this phone is blur. So if you are looking 100x zoom phone than this is not for you.if i talk about the system and built quality then system is same as other phone no changes have in this phone. Performance is good. But 5G speed is not better because I saw that when I get poor network then other 5g phone has getting better network. In the 4g level the network is not working. I think this is not value for money. This phone is only for best camera and best performance and gaming nothing else in this phone battery can run only 5 or 6 hours continuously without gaming. Company should increase the battery mAh. Company should give the gorilla glass protection and waterproof protection because if you are buying this phone it must be waterproof because as a value of the phone.,1,Positive

MANURAJ,"Dont go by words, pls read this before buying.",3.0,"I bought this mobile thinking of giving a try to a flagship. So exchanged my IQOO Z3, since I was using Z3 I liked IQOO's performance and camera with a value for money perception. So here is the basic review1. The performance is good !! but its an obvious for 8gen 32. Camera: Its all with great features and good pics but really disappointed for front camera atleast 32MP should be given.3.Battery: 1 day for medium use, less than 1 day for heavy usage4.VC Cooling: Dont know if its working properly for my device, just playing for 15 mins nd phone starts heating up, even my Z3 was not like that. (Attaching the image: here around 10 apps were opened but none were working on screen and phone was kept aside, when i pick it felt hot and then checked this)Biggest Concern: Amazon's trust.1. No replacement: I saw that there is no replacement present in the order window, only return which is also after deducting the launch offer(i.e. 5k)!! Wow2. There's an executive will be present to test weather return or replacement should be done or not, which means either the time runs out for your return window if the person will not come or its the mood of that person on which your hard earned money value is swinging.3. Doesnt allow to post Questions and reviews till 7-8 days, why are they afraid of the product quality?I already decreased my shopping from Amazon and this is another good reason they have provided.",1,Positive

Amit Akolkar,Better in camera for portrait till 3x but ban in zoom effects.,3.0,"Phone is good in performance wise. Camera is good till 3x portrait. Normal photos are also good till 3x but after that it starts adding noise in the photos.You will see some issue while playing videos on Netflix.After 50x zoom photp capture, it's automatically adding some effect that can reduce the quality of the photos. I don't know but from past updates don't know what iQOO is adding in software. But only photos with people faces are looking better. Otherwise instead of autocorrect the photo it's adding too much noise and red blue color in photo.Night photos are okay not as much clear when you compare to online reviews. Tried with different settings.Video stabilization is awesome in normal mode.Sometimes you can see stutter speed is taking around 3 4 second to capture a single photo. Settings are missing to reduce the shutter speed so you will endup capture a blury photo for moving object. It's available in pro mode only. But it automatically applied to 3 4 second for night portrait or normal photo sometimes. I don't know what IQOO is doing with the camera updates.",1,Positive
Used one and not sealed. Also item has dents.,"Very poor screen brightness, battery and sound quality",3.0,"Update:Battery issue is fixed. That's the software update bug which got resolved after another update.Screen brightness is not good and the sound quality is big down. Battery backup is very bad. I am charging thrice a day.

AmazonClient,Poor Front Camera,3.0,"IQoo 12 512 legendHave been using Vivo X90 pro, not new to Funtouch OS.Can't compare the two phones owing to difference in their rates.1) Screen is definitely a downgrade, not as fluid2) 512 storage is a +3) SOC 3 is fast4) Rear camera is decent not comparable to X90 pro5) Front camera is a sheer disappointment, doesn't retain the natural texture. Brightens the image to the extent of it being distorted.6) Minor tweaks on the App control functions helps the battery to last for a day with moderate usage. 120 watt charger is quick enough for heavy users7) Build quality could have been better for a phone at 57k, seems fragile and not sturdy enough8) No IP rating isn't something you expect from a phone claiming to be a flagship killerI hope that Iqoo works on it's Front Camera software and provides an update soon enough to make this a worthwhile purchase.",1,Positive
karthic,Real Flagship Killer,3.0,"No doubt about the performance of the phone definitely flagship performance.Software experience is always buggy and not that great. Most irritating thing in this phone is software experience every day we have to face one issue in this mobile UIIt will get heat sometime during charging or using the phone. But it got reduced after updates.If you want good telephoto lens for 50k, then go for it.Personally I don't like selfie camera and night photography for human subject.For 50k it does job.Before update:Mobile is getting heat on normal use.Android 14 needs improvement, lots of issues.",1,Positive

Shubham Kumavat,Impressive iQOO 12 - A True Flagship Experience💯💯💯,5.0,"I recently caught wind of iQOO's latest flagship release, the iQOO 12, and after extensive research, I took the plunge and purchased this device just two days ago. Let me share my experience with you.First and foremost, the camera setup on the iQOO 12 is nothing short of remarkable. Boasting a triple camera configuration of 50+50+64MP, the pictures captured are not only vivid but also showcase a unique and distinctive style that sets it apart from other iQOO models. Even compared to my sister's more expensive phone, the iQOO 12 outshines with its superior camera quality. I am genuinely delighted and satisfied with the camera performance.The design of the iQOO 12 is another standout feature. The metal sides give it a premium feel, and the device's grip is both comfortable and secure. The impressive build quality is evident, making it a pleasure to hold and use.The user interface is clean and intuitive, contributing to an overall positive user experience. Navigating through the device is a breeze, adding to my satisfaction with the iQOO 12.In terms of battery life, I am pleased with the performance so far. Although the charging time is approximately 25 minutes for a full charge, the endurance of the battery makes it bearable, as I don't find myself needing to charge frequently. A small trade-off for extended usage.Gaming on the iQOO 12 is a delight. I tried Call of Duty, and the smooth touch response, fast loading times, and immersive vibrations on kills left me thoroughly impressed. The device delivers a seamless gaming experience that enhances the overall satisfaction of owning this flagship phone.Overall, I consider the iQOO 12 a great purchase, especially for those looking for an exceptional gaming, multimedia, and camera experience within a budget of 50k. While there might be some software experience quirks, the device's performance in gaming, multimedia consumption, and photography make it a worthy investment that won't leave you disappointed. If you're in the market for a feature-packed smartphone, the iQOO 12 is a solid choice 💯😊😊",1,Positive
Tamil Azhagan,Review of IQOO 12 (16 GB RAM Variant),5.0,"I recently purchased this device on August 29, 2024, and so far, it’s been a heavenly experience, especially for gamers. If you play titles like BGMI, COD, or any other FPS-intensive games, this phone is an absolute beast. The performance is flawless, ensuring smooth gameplay without any hiccups.Camera Quality:The rear camera is among the best I’ve seen across brands. The Super Moon feature is quite impressive, capturing details in a way that very few devices can. I’ve attached a few sample pictures—take a look! The 8K video recording feature is also fantastic, delivering crisp and high-quality videos. The selfie camera quality isn't great, though I'm not sure if it's due to the tempered glass.Performance vs. iDevices:When it comes to performance, this phone gives direct competition to iDevices. Whether it's gaming, video recording, or multitasking, it holds up really well, making it a strong contender.Strange Finding:However, I did notice something odd. When I shake the phone near my ear, I hear something rattling inside. I'm not sure if everyone experiences this, but it's a bit concerning, and I’m hoping it’s not a significant issue.Overall, it's an exceptional device for gamers and multimedia enthusiasts, with only a minor concern that might need looking into.",1,Positive
ASHEEN,Very Impressive,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Writing this review after one month of usage,awesome performance, fast charging, good haptics, camera is really impressive specially the 3x potrait, UI is good funtouch OS not much issue here also got updates here, display and brightness is good even though phone like poco x6 pro which is less than 30k display almost near to it but not as bright as Iqoo. Also when I compared the display with Iphone 13 pro Max iqoo's display is better more vibrant.Haptics is good, phone is always butter smooth, videos using camera are also awesome even in indoor lighting conditions like malls etc. The built quality is also good mine is Red with vegan leather which feels good.120 fast charging is next level. Battery back up when saver is ON can last easily one day.But with heavy use u will need to charge in a day but as it's superfast no issues there.Cons:- Heating while charging which nowadays all phones does and while doing small  activities also sometimes. But not too much heating but heating is thereThough during heavy gaming it's not heating much surprisingly.No IP 68 rating.No 4k and EIS support in front camera.But overall at this price point it's a beast much better value for money than one plus 12. Hence giving it 5 star otherwise would have given 4 stars.",1,Positive
Sanjay,Best budget flagship of 2024 : Phone with DSLR ownership experience,4.0,"Using Iqoo 12 Alpha 512/16GB variant since a week.Camera is outstanding, phone operating performance is too smooth, network & data speed is awesome, data transfer is unbelievably outstanding, display is too good. Here I will rate individuals:Rear camera : 10/10Front camera : 7/10Display : 10/10Speakers : 9/10Network & Data : 10/10Wireless connectivity: 9/10Data transfer : 10/10 (Both wired & wireless)Build quality: As of now it seem strongOS : 7/10 (OS side improvement required a little bit, but you won't find issues though in routine)The phone stand different because of few following things which less discussed. It has WiFi 7 & UFS4.0, both makes data transfer wired & wirelss in smooth manner, There is no phone in this price can do this. Camera is really magical, normal, telephoto, portrait works really well. Also, OIS in video recording works really awesome, it has horizontal lock in OiS which records steady portrait video even if camera rotated 360 degree. Photos are well in low light too which you can't expect in this budget flagships. If you are about to purchase entry level DSLR along with phone, this phone can serve for both except few high end requirements. Front camera is okay or can say good if proper loght is there, Don't expect Vivo selfie feel in this. Charging speed is magical, it takes 30 minutes from 10% to 100%. There are some minor software issues are there which they are listening & working on too so no worries about it, they can resolve them in upcoming updates.I suggest to check all detailed technical specifications before purchasing as this is my personal experience review with my expectations. This is my first phone with such budget and I'm satisfied well for what i paid.Note : Few users may have reported battery drain and heating. I can say high network variations & constant heavy processing in CPU & GPU can make it, but as of now I've not faced either. If you use phone in well manner, it won't disappoint.",1,Positive
Pankaj Sharma,Honest Review after a week use,5.0,"Here's my review of the iQOO 12 5G after using it extensively for the past week.iQOO is known for offering performance phones that provide great value for money. Now, they are changing things up with the new iQOO 12 5G.Let's begin -Design- The design is more mature and in league with other flagships.- The BMW M sports branding at the bottom is a neat touch.- Steel flat sides look premium but easily pickup smudges.- Enamel glass on the back is a mix between glossy & matte. It's one of the best implementations on a phone.- Rear camera module is BIG!! Has that knurled finish metal ring for the regal feel.- The only downside is the sheer size, a curved panel would have made things better.Display- Excellent display quality, with the 144Hz RR which can go down to 1Hz.- Outdoors visibility is great & colors are on point.- Panel is ideal for watching HDR content, & playing games with that 2,160Hz PWM.- Good stereo speaker system with on-point sound separation, gets loud enough to fill a small room.Software- The experience is more refined with Android 14-based Funtouch OS 14.- UI is clean with modern touches, with limited Material You elements.- Although some apps were removed this time, you can still find bloatware.- Aside from that, Funtouch OS 14 gets you enough options to customize the UX like other custom skins on the market.Performance- You get the all-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 here, which is an excellent performer.- There are no complaints on the performance side.- The phone glides through all the stuff thrown at it.- Even under intense stress it doesn't heat up which cannot be said for the competitors.- It's got rock-solid gaming performance and the Q1 chip further smoothens things out.- Battery is just too good, got 7 hours of SOT with mixed-use.- 120W charger tops up the battery in under 30 minsCamera- This is yet another area where the iQOO 12 shines.- Brilliant camera performance on all 3 lenses.- The camera UI is clean & simple to use.- It's got the new Vivo color science that comes close to the Zeiss camera experience seen on Vivo's flagship X series phones.- This time there are three new photo style options,  Vivid, Textured, and Natural. I found the Vivid mode suitable for most scenarios.- The Natural mode stands out for better handling of foliage, preferred for more realistic shots.- Wide angle lens captures excellent photos, though there is still room for improvement.- The 3x telephoto lens adds versatility, particularly excelling in portrait shots.- Selfie game on the phone is a little weak thoughVerdictThis is the phone to get if you want top-notch performance, excellent battery life, and solid cameras, all for just ₹53,000 (under ₹50k with all the discounts).That said, there are some downsides to consider. Firstly, it lacks wireless charging and Gorilla glass protection. Additionally, it only offers 3 years of OS updates compared to the 5+ years provided by other flagship phones.Bottom line, iQOO has delivered a polished product that caters to all, not just avid gamers. The cherry on top is the crazy good price.",1,Positive

Saurabh Jain,"Great Handset, smooth and lagfree experience",5.0,"Bought IQOO 12 in the first sale, received device within 2 days as shown on Amazon.Received box in flawless condition.Unboxing experience was quite simple but good thing is box had all the things one require to start using device like CHARGER, case, screen gaurd applied. Wished they provided usb c to headphone jack adaptor too for some of the older folks how like to use wired headphones.First thing when I held the device was how light it felt in hand. Comparing with Nothing Phone 2 and S22 Ultra it felt super handy and light weight.Design wise, I liked it very much. Simple yet elegant looks, very comfortable in using also. Camera island is the highlight of the device and looks evident that IQOO team had given a lot of thought in designing. Having a boxy design helps in grip. Device sits nicely in hand and feels like a solid device. Still I would suggest a good case for better grip and protection. I ordered white colour and it looks just beautiful. BMW lines are now replaced with BMW stripe logo which gives an elegant and rich looks to the device. Side buttons are nicely positioned and are tactile and clicky.Display, in one word it's awesome. I have used a lot flagships and can say it's not at all inferior. It's a puch hole display and punch hole is moderately large in size. If it could been smaller in size it would have been brilliant. Brightness is very good and it's easily visible evev in bright sun. Colours look rich. Not a technical expert but can say display looks pleasent and wonderful. It's 1.5k display and looks quite sharp. You won't miss 2k much, to be honest I feel fhd+ is more then enough for mobile displays. Along with brightness, display can go ultra dim too. Turn on extra dim option from quick setting toggle to lower brightness even further if required.Processor wise, it have latest and fastest snapdragon processor, SD 8 Gen 3. Thanks to the processor device is extremely smooth and lag free. Scrolling, switching apps, multitasking, gaming all are quite fast and one can feel the difference if coming from 2 generation old flagship device or any mid range device.Regular usage doesn't heat up device at all. I was using S22 Ultra before this and it regularly got hot even in day to day tasks. But  IQOO 12 didn't heat up like that. In a week of usage of my handset never experienced any heating issues or hangups in device.Software wise, it's quite a good experience compared to older version of OS. As the IQOO team promised no hot app or hot games, it's not completely true. Once you open Vivo store app all the apps pop up but this time they can be removed. Few bloatware and duplicate apps are present too. But after removing bloatwares and disabling or muting notifications of apps you don't require experience gets pretty good.UI looks have been revamped and now it looks modern. IQOO/Vivo now needs to revamp their home launcher app. It lacks a lot of features like hidding apps, secure folder to name a few. Installing third party home launcher solves these issues but many widgets become unusable like weather, album etc. Dynamic effects also gets disabled on third party launcher which is a bummer.Battery life is quite good. Light usage can give you 2 days battery life easily. Moderate usage leaves you with 40% to 50% battery at the end of the day and heavy usage should leave you with 10% to 20% easily.Overall SoT on moderate usage which I got was around 8 hrs to 9 hrs. Charging is super fast with in the box 120w charger. Phone gets fully charged in less then half an hour. If they would have given wireless charging support too, it would have been great. But not much to miss though.All the required sensors are present like nfc, gyro, accelerometer and all works fine. No issues in proximity sensor also. Speakers are good not the best but much better then average.Using on 5G jio in Hyderabad, great reception and signal strength. No heating also even on 5G network (Moto edge 40 had this issue).Haptics are also very good not Apple level but very good still. Implemented very nicely and can be felt in all the places like typing, general scrolling etc.I am surprised why IQOO team chose to give usb 2.0 port for data transfer. I usually transfer files from mobile to pc and vice versa regularly. Having restricted speed means a lot of time for transfer. I didn't thought of it as a deal breaker but after usage I can say it is a deal breaker.Camera section is something where I don't have much experience. I don't use camera much. But whatever pics I have clicked gave very good results. For most it should be more then enough. For professional analysis look elsewhere. Daylight and night time shots boty came out pretty good for me. I am just point and click type of shooter😅.All in all I can easily recommend this device to any person who want a super fast device with stable os experience. Every thing in the device are functional and very thoughtfully designed device.Only major drawback is usb 2.0 port for data transfer and missing wireless charging. Slight more polishing in software section can improve the user experience even further.",1,Positive

I been using the device since 2 days no issues until now, great camera, great for gaming, front camera is not so bad. But the packaging is terrible, the phone that I got delivered already had its seal tampered on the box, the outer packaging done by amazon was not tampered, the inside of phone box had some dust as it was used by someone and it was repackaged and sent it to me. I decided to not trust amazon when purchasing smart phones in the future and go for other platforms. I am scared that the device I got may have some defects that I could not identify and it was set back by the person purchased first and later sent back to me without even resealing the box.",0,Negative
Vishal Banga,BEST BUDGET PERFORMANCE PHONE,5.0,"This phone appears to be all-rounder for me(after using >6 months). Battery backup is good. After using for >6 months battery is able to retain its health upto 99% which is great). Sometimes IQOO pushes updates that drains the battery faster, and then fix it in the next patch(probably a vicious cycle).Camera quality is good too.Phone get heated up during travelling because the phone is signal hungry so it does manage to gain more signals, but managed to dissipate the heat quickly but user experience is never decreased.Overall a good balanced phone from IQOO.",1,Positive
